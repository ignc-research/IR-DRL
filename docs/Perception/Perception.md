## Introduction

For the purpose of enabling object detection in both dynamic and static scenarios, we implement a voxelisation process on the point cloud data captured by our depth camera. This approach allows our agents to adapt effectively to various static environments. Furthermore, it provides the capability to respond to human intervention and dynamically appearing obstacles. This setup ensures a robust performance of our agents in diverse and changing conditions.
